# Micro

Micro is an abstract bullet-hell roguelite with shader-based graphics and an extensive metaprogression.

At least, it will be! It is far from finished, and its development lives in this repo.

Here's how it looks right now (or, since this README was last updated):

## Roadmap

The current goal is **v0.0.0**, a proof of concept of the early-game.

Here's what still needs to be done to achieve that:

- Settings menu
- More upgrades
- More enemies
- Basic structures
