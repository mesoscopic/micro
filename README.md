# Micro

Micro is an abstract bullet-hell roguelite with shader-based graphics and an extensive metaprogression.

At least, it will be! It is far from finished, and its development lives in this repo.

Here's some gameplay footage from when this README was last updated:

## Roadmap

The current goal is **v0.0.0**, a proof of concept of the early-game.

Here's what still needs to be done to achieve that, roughly in the order I intend to focus on it:

- Basic biomes and structures
- More enemies
- More upgrades
- Settings menu

Since there is currently no stable version, 1 commit = 1 beta (or tiny hotfix).

So, whatever you download from the build folder is the current beta.

When **v0.0.0** releases, I will move to a more traditional 1 commit = 1 feature and use git tags and all that.
