# Micro

Micro is an abstract bullet-hell roguelite with shader-based graphics and an extensive metaprogression.

At least, it will be! It is far from finished, and its development lives in this repo.

Here's some gameplay footage from when this README was last updated:

## Roadmap

**v0.0.0**, a "proof-of-concept" version, has been released, but is of course very incomplete.

A patch **v0.0.1** might come soon, but more likely the next version will be **v0.1.0**, in which I'll focus on adding more content to the world and fleshing out the early-game.

Here's what's planned for **v0.1.0**, roughly in order of importance:
- More features
- A healing rework
- More/better upgrades
- More biomes
- More enemies

Here's what's planned for the future, roughly in the order of when I plan to work on it:
- Balancing
- More \*insert thing there will be multiple of here\*
- Abilities
- Bosses
- A final superboss for each world
- Metaupgrades, etc.
