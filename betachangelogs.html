				<h1>Micro Changelogs</h1>
        <h2>
          0.1.0.5
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Work on the Crystal Clear update has begun simultaneous to the Hustle and Bustle Part II content.</li>
          <li>This update will clean and rework everything in the code, so expect bugs while it is being worked on but a cleaner (and more moddable?) program in the future</li>
          <li>Started work on enemy camps</li>
          <li>Redid the menu in the new system - no visual difference, but settings are easier to handle now</li>
          <li>I lied, I added a thing saying it's the beta to the title</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.1.0.4
        </h2>
        <p>
          Gave enemy camps an entity description, and made their spawning actually work right.
        </p>
        <h2>
          0.1.0.3
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Added The Paradigm Widens, which plays when the player unlocks a new row</li>
          <li>Added enemy camp generation, though the camps don't do anything</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.1.0.2
        </h2>
        <p>
          Finally, the Bustle part of the update is coming! Two songs have been added, replacing the awful placeholder music for exploration and boss themes.
          Note that these pieces are subject to change, and make sure to turn Music on in settings to hear them, as because it's an experimental feature, it defaults off.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Replaced An Absolutely Abominable Placeholder and The Other Explanation Theme from Micro: Placeholder Soundtrack with Out of Domain from Micro: Original Game Soundtrack</li>
          <li>Replaced It's The Boss! from Micro: Placeholder Soundtrack with Wagering Sacrifice from Micro: Original Game Soundtrack.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.1.0.1
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Tag icons are now data-driven</li>
          <li>The first wanderer in a world now does not despawn (though it will respawn, moving it). However, this is handled via a world flag, so the first wanderer that spawns in existing worlds after this update is released will never despawn either.</li>
        </ul>

          0.0.3.17

          <li>The shaded regions outside the first one now play safe zone music and heal you twice as fast</li>
          <li>Gave lower enemies scaling difficulty, and added an attack speed cap so the game wouldn't break</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>
          0.0.3.6
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Buildings that use the number keys now <b>actually</b> properly re-render the game (I keep doing this).</li>
          <li>The "soul well" has been renamed to "altar" in the code for more ambiguity.</li>
          <li>Altar bosses now have a 40% chance to dodge instead of attacking, making their fights more interesting.</li>
          <li>These bosses also now attack slightly faster.</li>
          <li>Healing and dodging now display cooldown time.</li>
          <li>Dodge cooldown time can now be reduced in the "armory".</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.0.3.5
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Obfuscated text was improved</li>
          <li>Buildings that use the number keys now properly re-render the game when used</li>
          <li>After some testing with contact-based combat, we have decided not to implement it. Instead, enemies can now only be hit when near their "starting position".</li>
          <li>Dodging will still be added to bosses later.</li>
          <li>I promise the Eastern land is coming, once I can finalize what I want with it</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.0.3.4
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Further revised the new layout, so that the info box is as large as it needs to be and the world shrinks accordingly</li>
          <li>Reworked the versioning system, including adding a dialog box when new updates come out (that might have led you here!)</li>
          <li>
            This hasn't been implemented, but there are potential plans for <b>contact-based combat:</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Attacks would stop when and if they hit the other belligerent, doing damage and animating the attacker back</li>
              <li>This would make combat more interesting, especially for enemies of different attack speeds</li>
              <li>Attack speed may be changeable in the armory, maybe as a tradeoff for damage?</li>
              <li>Bosses (and maybe some normal enemies depending on how powerful it is) may gain a dodging ability</li>
              <li>Basically, if one attacks the other, it does damage exactly like normal</li>
              <li>But if they meet in the middle, they both take damage and return to their starting positions</li>
              <li>Obviously, dodging prevents the enemy from hitting you</li>
              <li>We're open to feedback on this potentially upcoming combat mechanic (I know this should have been in 0.0.3 but I didn't think of it until now)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.0.3.3
        </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Added On A Quest to the placeholder soundtrack, which plays during quest scenes</li>
          <li>Implemented the Economy and The Safe Zone tracks, which play in the shaded area</li>
          <li>
            Changed Micro's rendering!
            <ul>
              <li>Important things like controls, gametime, and "workshop" status are always shown even if you have a massive inventory: they have dedicated space</li>
              <li>
                The Micro starting line thing has been moved into the body. This is for multiple reasons:
                <ul>
                  <li>It often confused new players</li>
                  <li>It better matches the WIP mobile version</li>
                  <li>Fixed rendering problems because the title would only visually update every second or so</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>Removed pesky scroll bars (you can still scroll though)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>FINALLY (hopefully) completely fixed that bug we keep talking about</li>
          <li>Beta now has its own save slot (so it doesn't confuse your release version), so you will start from scratch. However, if you run <code>localStorage.setItem('micro__betasave',localStorage.getItem('micro__gamesave'))</code> you can restore the progress you had, but the release and beta saves will still be different timelines</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>
          0.0.3.2
        </h2>
        <p>
          Actually fixed that bug from last time, and added more music to the placeholder soundtrack.
        </p>
        <h2>
          0.0.3.1
        </h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the first beta for the future Hustle and Bustle update! The game will now re-render when "wanderers" are obtained, and introduces a placeholder soundtrack functionality.
        </p>
        <h2>
          0.0.2.14
        </h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to Micro beta 0.0.2.14, the last of 0.0.3 betas! (The eastern land will be released in Micro's first minor-level update, 0.1, later on!)
        </p>
        <p>
          Now the entire "warp quest" is done. It essentially just provides some story to discovering the East, so play through, look for bugs, and tell me how you interpret the cutscenes! (Saves are still frozen, but they will be unfrozen when 0.0.3 releases).
        </p>
