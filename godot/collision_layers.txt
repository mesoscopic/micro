A guide to collision layers (for myself mostly):

Layer 1: Things all entities should collide with (i.e. walls)
Layer 2: Things enemies should collide with (player bullets)
Layer 3: Things the player should collide with (enemy bullets)
Layer 4: Things player bullets should collide with (enemies)
Layer 5: Things enemy bullets should collide with (players)
